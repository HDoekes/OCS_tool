# OCS_tool
A simple tool that allows the user to select a number of animals, enter a relationship matrix and vector of breeding values for these animals (as well as their sex) and then calculates the optimal contributions based on a set inbreeding penalty. 
It can also provide the optimal frontier with optimal trade-off solutions between genetic gain and inbreeding for different inbreeding penalties.
